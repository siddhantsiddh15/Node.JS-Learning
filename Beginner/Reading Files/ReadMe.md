## An introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a free open source environment which uses JavaScript to write server side code.

It can create, open, read, write, delete and close files on the server. 
In concise words, to manage the working of server Node.js is a very common and useful tool.

Node.js files have .js as extension type since the code are written in JavaScript.

The console will be in the terminal window not in the browser window unlike in our front end projects.

Node.js based server never stops the code execution while waiting for API to return data. The server moves to the next API after askin gfor data from an API. There is a notification mechanism of Node.js which tells regarding the response from API and due to this reason which makes the servers based on Node.js very fast.

Node.js is a single threaded model with event looping.

### Check the version of npm and node.js

``` node --version ``` -> Checks the version of Node installed on your local computer

``` npm -v ``` -> Checks the version of npm

These two commands will give results only after Node.js has been correctly installed on your system.

### Using the console in Node js

Go to the terminal and write ``` node ``` and press ``` Enter ``` . You will be able to open the console for Node now.

To exit the terminal you need to press ``` Ctrl + C ``` twice.
